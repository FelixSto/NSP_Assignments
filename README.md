# Nonlinear Signal Processing - Sophie and Felix

This repository contains the solution to the first Assignment of the Nonlinear Signal Processing problem classes (442.022) of Sophie Steger, and felix Stollberger.

The solutions to the problems with coding parts can be found in the ```/notebooks/assignments/``` folder, as well as in ```/src/models/```, where the implementations of the RBF-NN and the MLP-NN for the first task are found. The ```data``` folder contains mostly saved plots, which are relevant for the documentation of the code written in Jupyter. The Jupyter files of the first-, and the last problem where added to the LaTex report, and already contain the neccessary documentation.

The ```/pdf/``` folder contains only handwritten solutions to the problems 2-5, the same content can be found in the submittet LaTex report.
